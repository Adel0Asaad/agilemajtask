# GPU software manager
This is my public git repository for the agile practical exam for the fall semester for 2021

## Stakeholders
GPU manufacturers, GPU piece owners, Game devs.

## Near vision for the first two sprints
We should have the bare minimum of the software running and testable by this point, which includes a system to verify your GPU drivers version, and a system to allow you to update your drivers if they're outdated.
